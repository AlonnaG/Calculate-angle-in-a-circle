Calculate angle in a circle.

For this assignment we need to draw a circle on a stage and plot 3 random points along the circumfrence of the circle.
Then connect each point with a line to form a triangle.
We should display each angle of the triangle and allow the user to drag the pointsalong the circle to change the shape of the triangle while still displaying the angles.
