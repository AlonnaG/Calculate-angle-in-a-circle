# Calculate-angle-in-a-circle
Calculate angle in a circle.

Create	a	java	project	that:
- Draw	a	circle	with	three	random	initial points	on	the	circle.
- Link	the	points	to	form	a	triangle.
- Print the	angles values in	the	triangle.
- Use	the	mouse	to	drag	a	point	along	the perimeter	of	the	circle.	As	you	drag	it,	the triangle	and	angles	are	redisplayed
  dynamically.
